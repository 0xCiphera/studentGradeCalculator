# studentGradeCalculator
A guided Project aimed at strengthening the basic knowledge i have learnt in C#. 

It covers: literal and variable values, basic string formatting and basic operations on numbers.

I developed a Student Grading application that automates the calculation of current grades for each student in a class. The parameters for my application are:
- A short list of four students and their five assignment grades.
- Each assignment grade expressed as an integer value, 0-100, where 100 represents 100% correct.
- Final scores are calculated as an average of the five assignment scores.
- It performs basic math operations to calculate the final grades for each student.
- It outputs/displays each student’s name and final score.
